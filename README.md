The G7-Team has developed the Filmoteka project, a website for finding the most popular movies. The user can easily find a movie by keyword on the main page, get complete information about the movie (detailed description, rating, premiere date, genre and watch the movie trailer), as well as create his own movie collection.

# Modern approaches and technologies used in the project:

 1. Responsive layout
 2. Adaptive graphics
 3. Mobile First strategy
